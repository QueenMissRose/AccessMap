# Welcome to AccessMap

AccessMap is a web application that allows users to view a location's accessibility rating prior to their visit. Ratings are given on a 5-point scale (where 0 is least accessible and 5 is most accessible). There are multiple categories such as:

- Sensory Rating
  - Rates a location based on the tendency for sensory overload (i.e. sight, smell, hearing, et cetra)
- Mobility Rating
  - Rates how difficult the terrain is to navigate (i.e. slopes, uneven pavement, accessible parking, curb cuts, clear pathways, et cetra)
- Service Dog Relief Rating
  - Rates presence of appropriate places for service dogs to relieve themselves (i.e. grass, mulch, pebbles or dirt without landscaping or gardening that could be damaged, access to poop bags and trash cans, et cetra)
- Wheelchair Accessibility Rating
  - Rates a location based on wheelchair accessibility (elevators with space to accommodate the chair, accessible parking, accessible bathroom stalls)
- Common Allergen Rating
  - Rates a location based on the presence of common allergens (i.e. tree nuts, gluten, et cetra) and their protective measures against cross-contamination (if any)

The goal of this project is to prepare users to "know before they go"!
